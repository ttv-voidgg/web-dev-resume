_I&apos;m not really superstitious, but I guess I can take this a consideration. This is a message that I wrote to my team._

What you see in the image is a GitHub contribution grid, it shows a history of all the commits "changes that a person did for a specific time period.

For some reason I don&apos;t know, mine formed a shape of a house, this sort of stuff is sort of weird, because it can only happen if a person intentionally didn&apos;t submit any work for specific days. But this year, I&apos;ve been sort of on and off. Mind you, I wasn&apos;t monitoring this until yesterday.

So... What if... this is a sign? We must be on to something! Cause it&apos;s not just the math anymore, even the most random stuff are showing signs!

I guess our status here in Canada affects our values on how we perceive things, we&apos;re working harder compared to someone who&apos;s fully established. Why??? I know we know the answer, and that&apos;s why we&apos;re here in Canada!

I want us to keep that in mind; that we&apos;re here because we&apos;re on a mission to become a success soon. That we&apos;re going to take advantage of the fact that we are not in our comfort zone. We&apos;re going to use these challenges that we&apos;re experiencing to fuel our passion and drive us to success!

We must be up to something!
