<em>Just like the image above. That day, the Aurora cannot be seen. But it was actually around me and my friends, looking at us from above. I was able to capture it through long exposure. 

Like life, sometimes, we need to seek the ones that matters to us; looking hard, and long enough, for us to be able to appreciate their value...</em>

It’s been months now since I’ve started looking for a job... I don’t know if it’s the job market... or if it’s just me...

It’s so hard to find a company who’s willing to give me a shot, a company who’ll trust that I’m that passionate person that they’re looking for...

And to prove that... I’ve planned this journey a long time ago, 8 years to be exact (2018). Then I’ve started this back in 2022...

I can say, I’m still on track, and I still have that unwavering will, to pursue this dream! To start an adventure in a new world...

And even though I’m facing a lot of challenges... I know one thing is for sure...

I’m never gonna give up!

There are times of doubt... But, here I am standing strong... Until then, I need to work with what I have...

Well, for now... Until I get to join a team... While applying for hundreds (or maybe thousands already) of companies... seeking for the one to potentially give me a role...

I’ll drive my car... doing food deliveries... I believe this is a part in the adventure that will teach me how to become strong!

I believe that there’s a purpose to this... Maybe I’ll be holding a position that will require a lot of grit and fortitude...

I believe that everything happens for a reason...

And like a bison, I just need to have the strength and resilience to weather this winter... Maybe that’s the reason why in all the provinces of Canada, I’m in Manitoba...

I believe that I can do this!

By the way... I want to thank my Mom! I love you so much, Ma! Your love spans to the ends of the universe, and I’m very grateful and proud to be your son! I can’t wait to give the world to you! And I promise you that I’ll do my best; for you deserve the best!
