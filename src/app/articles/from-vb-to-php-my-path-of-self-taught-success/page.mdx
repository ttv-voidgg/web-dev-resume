Back in 2010, after I graduated with my bachelor’s degree in IT, the only programming languages I knew were VB6 and VB.Net. Yet, I applied for a position as an AD Builder at an Advertising Solutions Company. Their main language was ActionScript 2.0/3.0, but the problem was that I didn’t know how to program in AS2/3. Still, I studied tirelessly to get the job. Luckily, I landed the job and became one of the best Ad Builders in the company.

Since I knew Flash would be phased out due to compatibility issues with mobile devices and HTML5, I resigned and moved to another company. This time, I applied to an IT Solutions Company. Unfortunately, for the second time, I didn't know the required programming language—ASP Classic. I told the manager to give me a week to study ASP on my own, even without supervision. After a week, I learned it and landed the job. A few months later, they were happy with my performance and attitude, so they promoted me to consultant. I was sent to different companies to attend meetings, provide solutions, and work on various projects. The CEO and COO became my friends and taught me how to handle business.

Sadly, the company shut down. So once again, I searched for another job. For the third time in my life, I didn’t know the programming language required for the role—this time, it was PHP. I shared my previous experiences with the manager and assured her I would learn PHP in a week. She happily approved my request. And once again, after a week, I successfully learned PHP. I even trained a colleague who shared my passion for web development and later became a close friend.

Through these challenges, I learned the power of persistence and the importance of taking initiative. Each time I faced a language I didn't know, I took it as an opportunity to grow, and with each new skill, I gained more confidence in my abilities. The relationships I built along the way, from mentors to colleagues, have been invaluable in shaping my career. While the companies I worked for may have changed, the lessons I learned about adaptability, self-reliance, and continuous learning have stayed with me. Looking back, I'm proud of how far I've come, and I’m excited for the future opportunities to apply what I’ve learned and keep evolving in the tech world.
